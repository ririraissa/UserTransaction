# Step by Step to Generate Data

1. Open the [dummy.ipynb](https://github.com/ririraissa/UserTransaction/blob/main/dummy.ipynb) and adjust it according to the variable elements that you want to place in the data.

I created a new column named **"Category"** to group transactions based on their categories. This is done to facilitate the observation of transaction trends from month to month.
